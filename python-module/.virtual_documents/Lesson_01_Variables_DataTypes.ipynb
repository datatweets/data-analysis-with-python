# First Python code!












# Write your code here:






# Creating variables


# Print variables






# Python is case-sensitive!












# Same value for all


# Different values






# Write your code here:









# Basic math operations















# Combining string operations









# Real example






# Your code here:



























# Correct


# Wrong - this creates a tuple!


















# 1. Concatenation (joining strings)

# 2. Repetition


# 3. Length


# 4. Indexing (starts from 0)










































# From float to int

# From string to int






# From int to float


# From string to float






# From int to string

# Better with f-string:






# Get name (string)



# Get age (need to convert to int)



# Or in one line:









# Your code here:
first_name = ""    # Fill in your name
last_name = ""
age = 0            # Fill in your age
city = ""          # Fill in your city
job = ""           # Fill in your job

# Write introduction using f-string:
introduction = f"""

"""

print(introduction)





# Your code here:
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Print all operations:
# Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power





# Your code here:
weight = float(input("Enter weight (kg): "))
height = float(input("Enter height (m): "))

# Calculate BMI
# Print result with 2 decimal places (.2f)





# Convert km to miles
km = float(input("Distance in km: "))
# Your code here:


# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
celsius = float(input("Temperature in Celsius: "))
